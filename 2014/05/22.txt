[2014-05-22 22:15:55] lukeis: wat*
[2014-05-22 22:16:05] ddary: hi lukeis
[2014-05-22 22:16:09] ddary: yep :-)
[2014-05-22 22:16:19] lukeis: nice :) welcome back to the project ;)
[2014-05-22 22:16:36] ddary: and i just have seen somehow travis was not any longer building..
[2014-05-22 22:16:40] ddary: :)
[2014-05-22 22:16:50] lukeis: it hasn't been for a while… i have no idea how to fix it :)
[2014-05-22 22:17:39] ddary: for me it was looking like that the same dependencies in the pom may have created that issue
[2014-05-22 22:17:40] ddary: will see

[2014-05-22 22:55:15] ddary: good, the build is green again
[2014-05-22 22:55:55] ddary: i guess the reason was that somehow the old android support was/is broken in travis. but anyway, it seems like the new way works
[2014-05-22 22:56:33] lukeis: awesome :)
[2014-05-22 22:56:53] ddary: push to maven worked as well

[2014-05-22 23:29:48] lukeis: yeah, she's at salesforce… but not on my team, working on other things
[2014-05-22 23:29:57] lukeis: she was a summer intern :)
[2014-05-22 23:30:03] lukeis: (and then got hired)
[2014-05-22 23:30:35] lukeis: i have a new intern starting next week who gets to work on android stuff
[2014-05-22 23:31:08] ddary: ok, asking just because she has still commit rights…
[2014-05-22 23:31:29] ddary: and I was asking myself if that is needed
[2014-05-22 23:33:17] lukeis: likely not
[2014-05-22 23:33:38] lukeis: you can revoke (and if she starts on it again she can send pull requests)
[2014-05-22 23:36:49] ddary: ok, thanks for letting me know
