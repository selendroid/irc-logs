[2015-07-21 19:21:04] renee_: @lukeis: I have a grid setup and for some reason, every time I start my grid, it keeps throwing: Failed to check status of node: server response code:500
[2015-07-21 19:21:29] renee_: my json file config is as follows:
[2015-07-21 19:22:19] renee_: {   "capabilities": [{       "browserName": "android",       "maxInstances": 1,       "androidTarget": "ANDROID17",       "aut": "com.android.twitter:5.61.0-alpha.285"   }, {       "browserName": "android",       "maxInstances": 1,       "androidTarget":"ANDROID18",       "aut": "com.android.twitter:5.61.0-alpha.285"   }],   "configuration": {       "maxSession": 1,       "register": true,       "hubHost": "localhost",       "hubPor
[2015-07-21 19:23:00] renee_: any thoughts on how to resolve it??
[2015-07-21 19:24:49] lukeis: that doesn't appear to be your complete config json? can you :gist it?
[2015-07-21 19:25:34] lukeis: i could only guess that the "host" key in your "configuration" isn't set correctly?
[2015-07-21 19:25:52] lukeis: or maybe the "proxy" isn't set right?
[2015-07-21 19:26:29] lukeis: http://selendroid.io/scale.html  has a good example
[2015-07-21 19:29:03] renee_: https://gist.github.com/niranjani23/5484e22c77a0273d2e52
[2015-07-21 19:30:57] lukeis: and what's your command line(s) to start the grid hub / node?
[2015-07-21 19:41:06] renee_: https://gist.github.com/niranjani23/1e0b55778be2fa9d4b8e
[2015-07-21 19:41:20] renee_: contains both commands to start grid and node
[2015-07-21 19:44:11] renee_: am I missing something?
[2015-07-21 19:44:38] lukeis: doesn't look like it… you have the jars on the classpath where you start the command i asumme...
